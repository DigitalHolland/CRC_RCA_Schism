            <h4>Motives of the Afscheiding</h4>

            The situation of the Dutch migrant takes on new meaning when viewed in light of the socio-religious climate within the Netherlands. The Dutch <i>Hervormde Kerk</i>, or state-sanctioned church had been plagued by controversy in the decades after Napoleon’s downfall. Strict Calvinist critics lambasted the increasing state control and liberalism of the Hervormde Kerk and called for return to orthodoxy. The use of hymns instead of psalms and the practice of open communion were especially controversial issues. Government control over the training of clergy was one such issue that critics denounced as unjustifiable secular intrusion into the spiritual.[1] This finally culminated in the <i>Afscheiding</i> of 1834, when a number of prominent ministers and their congregations left the <i>Hervormde Kerk</i>.[2] Albertus Van Raalte, founding patron of Holland, was among them. By 1849, 1% of the population of the Netherlands had seceded from the <i>Hervormde Kerk</i>, a sizeable number. But this percentage pales when viewed alongside the fact that 50% of Dutch emigrants in the 1840s were seceded.[3]

            <h4>Seceded Immigrants</h4>

            <p>It is important to note that the story of the Seceders or <i>Gereformeerd</i> in the Netherlands post 1834 is not one of unrelenting persecution. While the state countered Seceded action with fines and penalties, by 1840, the decision had been made to allow the Seceders to be, although fines were still being issued.[4] Still, it is beyond doubt that in the 1840s, Seceders comprised a disproportionate percentage of emigrants leaving the Netherlands. What that proportion was is up for debate. Some sources contend that at the peak year of Dutch migration in the 1840s, 1847, Seceders only made up about 35% of the migrants.[5] Dr. Robert Swierenga has argued that these dissidents were about half of the Dutch population that left. Inconclusiveness aside, there is no debate that Seceders were disproportionately represented among these migrants.</p>
