           <h4>The Schism and Culture </h4> 

This timeline tells the story of the religious life of dutch migrants from their arrival in America to joining the RCA to the schisms that formed the CRC. However, their Dutch identify and cultural factors are closely linked to their religious life. Religious groups produce distinctive cultures and worldviews. Culture is defined as “the beliefs, customs, arts, etc., of a particular society, group, place, or time the beliefs, customs, arts, etc., of a particular society, group, place, or time.” [1] When Dutch settlers came to Holland, MI to flee religious persecution in the Netherlands, they also brought a certain culture - one that was very different from the American culture surrounding them. Separatist attitudes, the protection of orthodox purity, and the desire to preserve Dutch identity and culture were three factors that played a huge role in the experience of these migrants, including the secession of the Christian Reformed Church (CRC) out of the Reformed Church of America (RCA). [2] Minor differences today still cause these two denominations to stay separated. However, most members today of the RCA and CRC cannot specifically explain most of the differences that exist and want the two denominations to work more closely together. [3]

<h4>Secularization Theory</h4>

Two theories, secularization theory and modernization theory, are crucial for understanding the separatist attitude that many in the Dutch Reformed churches brought to America. [4] Both the RCA and CRC were responding to secularization. Secularization theory is rooted in modernization theory which “posits that modern societies stand in stark contrast to traditional societies,” and these differences largely affect people. [5] Modernization erodes religious commitment because of increased industrialization, urbanization, technology advancements, advanced education, etc. [6] Secularization has resulted in a decline of religious involvement, an increase in modernization, and a decrease in the ability religion has to influence public society. There are two responses available then to religious communities dealing with secularization: accommodation to culture or resistance to culture. It was in this choice that the RCA and CRC differed.

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>

The RCA and CRC have similar heritage, liturgy, and culture. However, the CRC has historically placed greater emphasis on doctrinal purity and the RCA has been more focused on church unity. [7] The CRC broke off from the RCA due to concerns that the RCA was not theologically pure after becoming "Americanized." Yet overall, the nineteenth-century secession was not based solely on theological differences; there were many cultural factors that played a role in the schism. [8] As will be demonstrated in the timeline, both church denominations shared a common heritage and background.  However, differences in theology and doctrinal purity, in the face of cultural change, ultimately resulted in a denominational schism between the two.</p>

            <h4><i>The Afscheiding</i></h4>

The situation of the Dutch migrant takes on new meaning when viewed in light of the socio-religious climate within the Netherlands. The Dutch <i>Hervormde Kerk</i>, or state-sanctioned church, had been plagued by controversy in the decades after Napoleon’s downfall.In 1795, Napoleon’s revolutionary army came through the Netherlands, bringing anticlerical attitudes with them. Few Dutch protested this. The Enlightenment gained way through Europe during this time as well, which increased the tolerance of varied religions and theological differences [1]. Deism, a belief in an unknowable deity, replaced Reformed doctrine in Netherland’s public schools during the early 1800’s. In addition, the king decreed the Church Order of 1816 as official law of the land. This Church Order established the Hervomde Kerk (the state church) as the only religious body supported by the state for public worship [2]. Many pastors throughout the Netherlands supported this law. However, conservative Dutch Calvinists did not approve of these changes and felt it hindered their freedom of religion.

Strict Calvinist critics lambasted the increasing state control and liberalism of the <i>Hervormde Kerk</i> that occurred in the years after Napoleon's downfall and called for return to orthodoxy.The use of hymns instead of psalms and the practice of open communion were especially controversial issues. Government control over the training of clergy was one such issue that critics denounced as unjustifiable secular intrusion into the spiritual.[3] This finally culminated in the Afscheiding of 1834, when a number of prominent ministers and their congregations left the Hervormde Kerk.[4] Albertus Van Raalte, founding patron of Holland, was among them. By 1849, 1% of the population of the Netherlands had seceded from the <i>Hervormde Kerk</i>, a sizeable number. But this percentage pales when viewed alongside the fact that 50% of Dutch emigrants in the 1840s were seceded.[5]

 

<h4>Seceded Immigrants</h4>
<p>
It is important to note that the story of the Seceders or <i>Gereformeerd</i> (Reformed) in the Netherlands post 1834 is not one of unrelenting persecution. While the state countered Seceded action with fines and penalties, by 1840, the decision had been made to allow the Seceders to be, although fines were still being issued.[6] Still, it is beyond doubt that in the 1840s, Seceders comprised a disproportionate percentage of emigrants leaving the Netherlands. What that proportion was is up for debate. Some sources contend that at the peak year of Dutch migration in the 1840s, 1847, Seceders only made up about 35% of the migrants.[7] Dr. Robert Swierenga has argued that these dissidents were about half of the Dutch population that left.[8] Inconclusiveness aside, there is no debate that Seceders were disproportionately represented among these migrants.

           <h4>The Difficulty of Making Generalizations</h4>

It is difficult to make a general statement about the ultimate push factors that drove Dutch migrants to leave their homeland. Migration was a different process across the Netherlands, and it is impossible to make a sweeping generalization about the reason why so many left in the years prior to the Secession of 1857. It has already been concluded that the Netherlands was not in the same position as Ireland and other neighboring states in economic and agricultural health. This argument comes into new light when one considers that about 60% of migrants from Friesland in the 1880s were of the middling sort. [1] White collar emigrants, who made up about 40% of the employed populace in the Netherlands, only comprised about 10% of emigrants.[2] It can  tentatively be assumed that this was constant throughout all years of Dutch migration in the nineteenth century, with the upper class staying put and the poor having no means with which to migrate.

<h4>Class and Migration</h4>

Thus, a snapshot of the Dutch immigrants of the nineteenth century emerges. It can be tentatively concluded that most migrants from the Netherlands in this period were middle class or upper-lower class, the segments of society which were not well endowed but had enough resources to leave when potato and rye famine declined. Denominationally, they were a hodge-podge of different creeds, with Seceded Calvinist Protestants comprising a disproportionately high percentage of the migrants. Geographically, the northern provinces of Drenthe and Friesland were the provinces of origin for many of the migrants. Most of these were rural males.[3]

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Thus, all though this is too simplistic a conclusion, the Dutch migrant of the nineteenth century can be characterized as being a rural male laborer, with enough resources to migrate. He would have been more likely to be a Seceder than the rest of the population. He would most likely be from Drenthe, Groningen, Zeeland, Friesland or Flevoland.[4] If this migrant is wholly average in every way, he is 23.08 years old, the mean age of migrant males in this era.[5]</p>

           <H4>Settling in America</H4>

The union and secession with Reformed Church in America can best be understood with some background knowledge of the Dutch people in America. The Dutch originally came to America when the Dutch West India Company set up trade from Manhattan Island in the early 1620’s. These settlers soon formed the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church as a branch of the Hervormde Kerk in the Netherlands.[1] The church thrived in New Amsterdam, especially since the director of the island banned other religious groups such as the Quakers and Lutherans so that the Dutch colonists  “could worship in the Dutch manner without any threat from ‘outsiders’.” [2] In 1664, the English conquered this Dutch colony, but the church continued to report to Classis Amsterdam and conduct services in the Dutch language.

 

<H4>Americanization</H4>

In the 1700s, the RCA began to move towards Americanization. For instance,  after a lengthy conflict, the church gained permission to train and ordain their ministers in America instead of the Netherlands. The New York congregation also began holding services in English since the young people in the church no longer understood the Dutch language. During the Revolutionary War, most church members remained loyal to America, and this war mentality further distanced them from the Netherlands.  When the war finished and America broke ties with Britain, the Dutch church realized that it was not practical to stay tied to their Dutch roots in the Netherlands. [3] The Dutch churches in America turned to John Livingston to create a constitution for their churches that was separate from the authority of the Netherlands. Livingston was a professor at New Brunswick Theological Seminary and emphasized the learning of righteousness rather than academic pursuit. John Livingston finished the Explanatory Articles in 1792, and they included a new organizational system of the Canons of Dort specified for Dutch American Christians. [4] Livingston emphasized the need for unity among the church in these articles. These articles called the Dutch out of their ethnic separatism to participate in American culture and society. As a result of the Explanatory Articles, the Dutch church in America tried to adhere to their Dutch identity while involving itself in American church life otherwise. [5]

<h4>The Work of Hopkins</h4>

Soon after the publishing of Livingston’s document, Jonathan Hopkins, a student and supporter of Jonathan Edwards, rose as an influential theologian of the time. In the early 1800s he resurfaced issues on free will, limited atonement, and original sin, causing conflict in the Dutch church in America once again. [6] The Albany Synod in the north was against the New York City Synod in the south on these issues. The Southern Synod stuck with orthodoxy and doctrinal purity, while the Northern Synod concerned themselves with winning converts and growing their church bodies. [7]

Some Dutch-Americans stayed committed to a strict interpretation of the Canons of Dort. Tensions rose, and the General Synod called Synod of 1822 as a result. This meeting ended with twenty-six churches and twenty-four ministers seceding from the RCA, and they formed the “True Reformed Dutch Church.”[8]

By the mid-1800s, the RCA had been through two hundred years of Americanization. It was clear that the RCA no longer put strict adherence to doctrine as more important than open engagement with other churches and denominations. This  practice would set the denomination up for confrontation with more conservative Dutch migrant members in the following years. [9]

<h4>The Same Church…but Different</h4>

<p>Although the RCA did adapt to American life, they did not experience the influence of the Enlightenment in Europe that contributed to the liberalization of the Hervormde Kerk. When members of the Christian Seceded Church (a product of the Afscheiding) came to America, they were met with a church that held to the same doctrinal standards of the Synod of Dordt, yet with subtle cultural differences. The use of the English language in services, members from other Reformed groups in Germany and France, and an English songbook clearly indicated that it was no longer the same Dutch church that settled in New Amsterdam.[10]</p>

            <h4>Dutch Migration in the 1840s</h4>

The schism of 1857 may have been American in setting, but it was Dutch in character and nature. The prime movers and actors in this drama were Netherland-born emigrants and spoke Dutch. The chief theological concerns and issues were not particularly novel, but were rather new manifestations of the problems that had caused many to leave Holland in the first place. The clashes between these conservative new-arrivals and the Reformed Church of America would be interpreted through the lens of Dutch politics. The fact that the Dutch emigrant communities of the Upper Midwest clashed with their theological co-religionists from the east in the years after arriving is a telling one. Any discussion of the schism must understand the context in which Dutch emigrants left their motherland and settled on American soil.

<h4>The Netherlands in the 1800s</h4>

Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, conditions within the Netherlands did not seem ripe for a mass exodus. Compared to the war-ravaged powers of Europe, such as France, Prussia and Russia, the Netherlands was on much more secure footing in terms of industry, population, agriculture, and education in the wake of the Napoleonic wars.[1] The theme of ‘push factors’, often used in historiography to describe Jewish or Polish migration of the second half of the century, does not neatly fit onto the Netherlands, which was in many respects in a better position than the rest of the continent circa 1830.

<h4>The Potato Blight</h4>

Yet issues still existed which contributed to migration patterns. Land and wealth were concentrated in the hands of a small segment of the population. Most agricultural laborers did not own land, but worked it for a landed farmer. Many of the migrants of the period would come from these unlanded hands, who owned little property. The position of these laborers would be exacerbated by the same blight that crippled the Irish potato harvest in the 1840s. The 1840s saw massive crop failure across Western and Central Europe due to potato and rye blight and the Netherlands was not spared this turmoil. The average Dutch citizen ate approximately . Seven kilos of potatoes prior to the coming of the potato blight in 1845.[2] This is higher than the average Belgian, Swede, or Frenchman, but lower than the whopping two kilos of potatoes the average Irishman consumed in a day. About 11 percent of the arable land in the Netherlands was dedicated to growing potatoes, which put the nation squarely in the middling ranks of potatoes-growing nations on the continent. Spain was at the bottom of this group with two percent of its lands dedicated to potatoes, and Ireland led the way with 32 percent of its arable land cultivated by potatoes. Thus, it can be seen that, prior to the blight and subsequent potato failure, the potato played a prominent, although not dominant role in the Dutch agricultural economy. This may explain the staggering 71 percent decrease in potato yields in the year 1845 in the country, as other crops were available to replace a dismal potato harvest.[3] Thus, the significance and impact of the blight on Dutch society would not be nearly as catastrophic as in Ireland during the same time period.

<h4>The Result of the Blight</h4>

<p>Still, such a huge decline would have ramifications on the nation, even if not on the same apocalyptic scale as in Ireland.  Such a monstrous dip in potato production had a profound impact on these poor workers who relied on the staple as a staple. Even more disastrous for Dutch citizens was the 47 percent decline in rye yield which followed in 1846, with other neighboring nations suffering from a rye blight as well.[4] The picture that begins to emerge of the Netherlands during this time period is a country in a turbulent context. While the economic and subsistent situation within the nation was in decline, it was not a special case in Western Europe. The reader must be cautioned to remember that the number of Dutch emigrants who departed in this time period pales when compared with the throngs of people from neighboring nations who went to America in the same years. Between 1846 and 1850, a mere 12,000 Dutch left their motherland, as opposed to 450,000 Germans and a staggering 950,000 Irish.[5] It can be concluded that conditions within the Netherlands and opportunities for departure were not as conducive to emigration as in the other nations of Europe. Local relief boards were able to give welfare to about a fifth of the population in the years after the crops failures of 1845 and 1846, which show that some social support existed in the nation. This may explain the low numbers of emigrants, as opposed to the evictions and clearances that characterized landlord responses to famine in Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. The idea of poor, destitute Dutch immigrants thus falls by the wayside. As previously noted, ‘push factors’ certainly did exist within the country, but Dutch emigration was not as commonplace as Irish, German or Scottish resettlement in the same time period. It must be concluded that there were other motivations for emigration.</p>

          <h3 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">The Impact of the Union on the RCA</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">

<p>It is clear that the union with the RCA provided much needed financial support for the early Holland Classis, but the union was also extremely beneficial to the long term survival of the RCA. In fact, one of the reasons that the RCA sought out the union was a desire to continue mission efforts on the American frontier. Of the 40 non-Dutch RCA congregations started in the mid-west, only four of them are still in existence. Thus, the Dutch colonists gave them a huge boost in establishing themselves on the frontier.[1] Without gaining this foothold in other parts of America, the RCA may have rapidly increased its pace of Americanization in order to survive as a denomination.[2] The RCA would also arguably no longer exist as a unique denomination apart from the Union of 1850. Starting in the late nineteenth century, the RCA sought to merge several times with the German Reformed Churches and Presbyterians. However, every union has been vetoed by members from the Dutch immigrant Afscheiding churches, keeping the RCA an individual denomination still in existence today.[3] Finally, it is worth noting that the divisions between the RCA and CRC ensured a unique pattern of growth; congregations of the two denominations can still be found within close proximity of each other in towns across America.</p>

          <h3 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Secession and the Dutch Language</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
           The issue of usage of the Dutch language was tangential to the schism between these two denominations, it but proved to be one of the most clearly demarcated differences between the CRC and RCA in the years after the Masonic controversy. Most of the congregations that seceded in the initial secession of 1857 were comprised of Dutch immigrants who had not been in the United States longer than a decade or so. Dutch was their main language and was present in all of their churches. At the time of the Masonic controversy in the early 1880s, this was still a key difference between the western congregations of the RCA and the eastern heart of the denomination. These western congregations, swelled with Dutch-speaking immigrants, would be the ones who would reject the RCA for its refusal to condemn Freemasonry. At the same time, native Dutch-speakers continued to migrate to the United States. Typically, they would join the CRC, but the RCA’s net membership in the 1880s grew as a result of Dutch migration, thus obscuring the loss of so many congregations.[1]

 

<h4>Language in the Churches</h4>

While Dutch speakers joined both the CRC and RCA once established in America, their linguistic habits diverged here. Many of the CRC congregations spoke exclusively in Dutch whereas the RCA was composed mainly of older Dutch-Americans who had been assimilated into Anglophone America over time. Thus, there was no impetus to learn English for church services in CRC circles, while immigrants who joined the RCA would have to understand some English in order to communicate in their churches.

Many Dutch settlers that came in the mid 1800s were absolutely against the use of English language in church and adopting American culture. However, this did not stop the use of the English language in some Dutch circles. Many CRC churches refused to use the English language in their worship services when they first seceded. [2] For the first twenty years Holland, MI existed, it had no newspapers written in the English language. By the late 1800s, Holland had three Dutch newspapers regularly published: <i>De Hope, De Grondwet, De Hollander</i>. However, in time, it became impossible to not incorporate the English language in worship services if congregations wanted significant membership, especially since the next generation was growing up speaking English. Third Reformed Church was the most liberal church in its area with regards to the English language, and they were the first congregation in Holland to conduct services in English. [3]

Several internal and external factors caused the English language to emmerge in Reformed churches throughout Holland. The public schools, although made up of primarily Dutch speaking children, were taught in English. [4] As the city of Holland grew, there were more American citizens of non-Dutch descent that settled there. In addition, Hope College brought English-speaking people of Dutch Reformed descent from regions outside of Michigan to be on their faculty. [5] The Holland City News, published in the mid 1800s, used only English in their publications. The pastor at Third Reformed during the 1870s, Henry Utterwick, began holding two services: one in English and one in Dutch. [6] However, many in the congregation disagreed with this and the majority of congregations in Holland continued to speak in Dutch.

 <h4>Linguistic Nationalism</h4>

The attention paid to preserving Dutch in CRC circles was not a mere effort at ethnic preservation, although this was certainly one motivation. At the heart of this lay the belief that as the fundamental historic doctrines of the Reformed tradition were in Dutch, all Reformed members ought to be able to read Dutch.[7] Many Dutch parents also worried about losing the ability to communicate with their children and to control their reading habits should the children learn English.[8] Standard Dutch also may have been kept as the lingua franca in CRC churches out of necessity. Early waves of immigrants found themselves unable to communicate well with their fellow Dutchmen, due to divergent dialects and accents. One Dutch woman in Zeeland, MI in the mid-nineteenth century could not communicate with her next door neighbor, as one was a Zeelander and one was from Drenthe.[9] Standard Dutch eventually swallowed up this provincial differences in languages, but the necessity of promoting nationalism and identity through language remained.

 

<h4>The CRC and the Preservation of Dutch</h4>

In 1911, there were 189 CRC congregations, 164 of which spoke primarily in Dutch. Ten in East Friesland, Iowa used German and the remaining congregations conducted services in English.[10] In 1915, the number of total CRC congregations had swelled to 223 congregations, but a mere 17 were Anglophone.[11] The CRC maintained a Dutch-language newsletter called De Watcher until 1985, which is nothing short of extraordinary considering the diminished Dutch-reading population.[12]

<p>It becomes apparent that while the CRC seceded over their theological objections to RCA doctrines, the preservation of Dutch-culture and more specifically Dutch language, was a tangential process to secession. Those Dutch-speaking immigrants who entered the United States in the years after 1857 were much more likely to join the CRC out of linguistic convenience. This is evidenced by the fact that so many <i>Hervormde Kerk</i> immigrants joined the CRC, rather than the theologically similar RCA.[13] While perhaps not the original intent of the first founders of the Christian Reformed Church, the preservation of Dutch culture and language in the CRC was an unintended result of the schism.</p>

          <h3 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Reasons for the 1857 Secession</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
           <h4>The Union of 1850</h4>

For many that left the RCA in 1857, the letters sent to Holland Classis were not an act of secession, but rather a return to the principles of the 1834 secession in the Netherlands. Though each church held specific complaints, they believed that the RCA had strayed from the principles of Reformed doctrine and had become a false church. With this in mind, some have made the argument that the root cause of the secession of 1857 was actually the union of 1850 itself, a union that never made sense for many of the conservative Dutch immigrants. As noted in the timeline, the decision to unite was initiated by the RCA, pushed by Van Raalte, and lacked a formal decision made by the entire Holland Classis. Many of the churches that left in 1857 did not have any representatives sign the June 1849 letter that declared the desire of Holland Classis to join the RCA, and several conflicts leading up to the formal secession reveal that not everyone was completely satisfied with the union.[1] In fact, the secessionists themselves used the language of “returning” to an independent status, making the argument that the Union of 1850 was actually illegitimate. They also referred to Rev. Wykoff’s promise that they could leave the RCA if they ever changed their minds.[2] However, the emphasis on the benefits or faults of the union varies greatly depending on which side tells the history.

<h4>Liturgy and Theology</h4>

<p>The dissatisfaction with the Union of 1850 was formally expressed in the four letters sent to Holland Classis in 1857 from the congregations of Nordeloos, Grand Rapids, Polkton, and Graafschap. These letters reveal that the primary complaints of the secessionists were that the RCA:</p>

<p>
<li>Used hymns in public worship</li>
<li>Practiced open communion (anyone could participate in the sacrament of communion)</li>
<li>Neglected the preaching of the Heidelberg Catechism</li>
</p>

<p>Some also expressed concern that the RCA was neglecting the practice of family visitation, allowing permanent eldership, and refusing to keep the festival days (Christmas, Good Friday, Resurrection, and Pentecost). In his letter, Rev. Koene Vanden Bosch of the Noordeloos congregation did not give specific complaints, but expressed general disgust at the “abominable and church-destroying heresy and sins rampant in [the RCA].”[3] Rev. Hendrik G. Klijn of Grand Rapids took a more reconciliatory tone, pleading that Holland Classis remember the spirit of the 1834 Sesession which believed, “the church, the Bride of Christ, is a garden enclosed, a well shut-up, and a fountain sealed.” [4]  Between 1880 and 1884, the RCA again lost many members (about one tenth of the members in the Western churches) over their tolerance of membership in Masonic lodges.[5] Many opposed the freemasons because of it’s roots in the enlightenment, secrecy, and demand of loyalty to an organization other than the church. All of these issues can be traced back to a foundational belief in preserving the purity of the true church.</p>

<h4>Source of Perceptions of the RCA</h4>

<p>In light of the 1834 Secession in the Netherlands, these colonists’ desire to remain pure in doctrine is certainly understandable, yet it is worth noting how they came to these conclusions about the RCA. In their book, Family Quarrels, Swierenga and Bruins note that many of the colonists were unable to read English and thus unable to read the teachings of the RCA for themselves.[6] They were informed by observations of discontinuities in their own congregations, but more importantly, observations from prominent church leaders in the East. Gysbert Haan, an elder from Grand Rapids who left the RCA prior just before 1857, worshipped in the RCA churches in Albany and Rochester before settling in West Michigan in 1850. He reported certain “irregularities” in the RCA such as membership in masonic lodges, open communion, and the use of hymns and choirs in public worship.[7] The churches in West Michigan also received a letter from Rev. Jan Berdan from the True Reformed Protestant Church. This church had seceded from the RCA back in 1822, and in his letter Berdan accused the RCA of not preaching the truths of total depravity and limited atonement, two doctrines critical to Reformed theology.[8] The complaints against the RCA were also intensified when new ministers from the Netherlands came to West Michigan. These new ministers had not experienced the crucial support of the RCA during the early years of the colony and found it easier to be critical of the denomination. All of these observations of Americanization in the RCA combined with a separatist mentality brought from the Netherlands made the return to independence a natural move for many of the Dutch immigrants.</p>

           <h4>Aftermath of the Secession</h4>

Van Raalte was understandably frustrated by the conflict in the Holland Classis and condemned the actions of the secessionists. He believed their secession was a matter of ignorance and was disdainful of their attempts to create a “holier and purer” church. Van Raalte remained convinced that the RCA still held to the standards of the Synod of Dordt, but for the secessionists, it was a matter of how strictly the church held to these standards.  The leaders of the Dutch in America formed a spectrum of agreement with the RCA. While Van Raalte was willing to allow compromises such as membership in the Freemasons, others such as Haan and Vanden Bosch held strictly to the doctrinal standards of the Canons of Dordt.[1]

 

<h4>The Early Years of the CRC</h4>

<p>The secessionists of 1857 numbered only about 750 individuals (ten percent of the members of the Classis of Holland), and it took several years to fully establish themselves as a viable denomination.  Almost immediately after forming, the group sought to rejoin their mother church in the Netherlands, the CGKN. This desire for reunion was never fulfilled despite repeated appeals. For many years the early CRC struggled without solid leaders and several small conflicts broke out within the denomination. Yet the church was held together by the lay people who remained firm in their conviction to hold to the Canons of Dort without compromise. This preservation of their doctrinal heritage would eventually lead to growth as the problem of membership in Masonic lodges grew in the RCA and new immigrants from the Netherlands chose to join the CRC as a result.[2]</p>

          <h3 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Church Involvement in the American Civil War</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
           <h4>The Antebellum (Pre-War) Period</h4>

The first half of the 19th century was a time of political tension in the United States.  States north of the Mason-Dixon Line did not permit slavery; southern states did.  The economies of many southern states relied heavily on cotton production.  Cotton was difficult to harvest and required large numbers of manual laborers.  It was difficult to get cotton off of the plant, and before the cotton gin, it was very difficult to get the seeds out of the cotton.  The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 made cotton production profitable, but it only enabled plantation owners to increase their harvests and expand their operations.  As a result, slave populations in the American South exploded.

<h4>Secession</h4>

After Abraham Lincoln’s election as the 16th President of the United States, Southern states who had threatened secession did so.  In their view, the Republicans (led by Lincoln) were hypocritically using moral arguments to chip away at the backbone of the South’s economy and make their own states more powerful.  South Carolina was the first to secede and become the first state in the Confederacy in February of 1861.  U.S. government troops stationed in the city of Charleston were forced to withdraw to Fort Sumter, which was in the Charleston harbor.  The situation was untenable; on April 12th, 1861, Confederate artillery fired on Fort Sumter.  For the next five years, the United States would be engulfed in a destructive and bloody civil war.

<h4>Involvement and Withdrawal</h4>

<p>The Civil War divided families across state lines, and it also divided American Christianity.  Many Northern Protestant churches held that Divine Providence would bring an end to slavery; when the war came, their support for the Union cause was virtually unanimous.[1]  In 1862 at its General Synod, the RCA issued a resolution expressing full support for the Union cause and stating that God would bless the Union armies and “eradicate all the causes of this rebellion.”[2]  The RCA’s position focused more on the rebellion against earthly authority than on slavery itself; while the General Synod recommended that churches donate to the American Colonization Society (a society dedicated to sending slaves back to Africa), it did not express openly abolitionist views.[3]  The CRC’s position on the war was much less open and visible.  As an organization that was by definition somewhat withdrawn from broader American culture, the CRC did not directly address slavery or the rebellion.  However, it did expect its members to remain obedient to their government.  Members who slandered the Federal government were to be denied Communion, according to the Synod meeting minutes from October, 1863.[4]</p>

           <h4>Historic Attitudes</h4>

Differences in historic attitudes toward primary education between the Reformed Church in America and the Christian Reformed Church reflect differences in cultural assimilation.  These differences, while marked, are quite subtle.  Neither denomination was initially successful in creating a system of Reformed day schools.  Both denominations faced similar issues: lack of resources, lack of popular interest, and a changing American cultural landscape.  The difference between the RCA and the CRC lay in differing worldviews and church cultures.

<h4>RCA Primary Schools</h4>

In June of 1857, several months after several congregations had left the RCA, the General Synod of the RCA addressed the apparent need for Christian primary schools.  “The question concerning parochial schools is one of immense importance,”[1] read the minutes.  The RCA delegates agreed that primary education was important; however, there was little sense of urgency.  The difficulties of forming parochial schools made for delays.  Training teachers with the appropriate skills, finding good textbooks, and building schools would all take time.

In 1859, the General Synod of the RCA again brought up parochial schools.  They noted that there seemed to be an increasing interest in providing primary education in the Reformed tradition.  Nationwide, twenty schools were already in existence; however, the Synod found it “regrettable, however, that not more than one half of them have forwarded the statistical statements, which they are under obligation to furnish.”[2]  By 1860, the number of functioning schools was down to fourteen.  However, the RCA’s administrative support for these schools seemed as strong as ever:

“These schools are nurseries of the Church, as well as institutions for intellectual training, and morality and religion, as well as sound learning, will be promoted by their establishment wherever they are practicable.  The reckless attempts which are being made to divorce religion from education in our public schools, should lead the friends of the Church to found as many as possible of those institutions which, by their very constitution, are fortified against the attacks of Romanism and Infidelity.  The amount of contributions from Churches to the Parochial School Fund during the past year is very small, while few applications have been received for aid from the funds originally contributed and invested.  Several of the schools formerly aided have become self-sustaining.”[3]

Still, despite stated support for Reformed parochial schooling at the highest levels of the RCA, monetary contributions toward parochial schooling from the congregations were clearly insufficient.

Thus, the RCA as a church body seemed content with public schooling.  Even if the General Synod delegates agreed that religious primary education was a necessity, the majority of the members supported American public education.  In areas like Holland, where a majority of the citizens identified with the Reformed tradition, many of the teachers were Reformed as well.  In this case, the only difference between a public school and a parochial school would be the financial burden that the latter would pose.  Given the local situation, the members of RCA congregations felt that public schools were adequate at least.

<h4>The CRC on Schooling</h4>

In contrast to the Reformed Church in America, the Christian Reformed Church presented itself as a strictly orthodox Calvinist organization resistant to common American cultural influences.  As such, its attitudes toward culture and education were more conservative.  Four years into its existence, the CRC was already discussing day schools.  The preservation of the Dutch language was of particular interest: “The Brothers consider it of the greatest importance to guard the Holland language thru (sic) generations and the Assembly should see to it that the Holland language be stressed in Education.”[4]  Educating students in the Reformed tradition was a given; the delegates at the Classical Synod in Grand Rapids in June of 1861 agreed that the preservation of the Dutch tongue was a critically important part of primary education.  Dutch language and culture were vital parts of the larger Dutch Reformed identity that many of the CRC’s members held so dear.

<h4>The Beginning of CRC Schooling</h4>

Limited in size and resources, the CRC had a slow start, but at the General Assembly on June 15th and 16th, 1870, primary schools resurfaced in the discussions.  Article 36 of the minutes reads: “It is the duty of the Church to acquire free schools; and if this be impossible, then to provide to a greater extent for instruction in the Holland language and Reformed teaching.  This the Assembly impresses on the Consistories and the Churches.”[5]  Again, the Dutch language and Reformed doctrine were presented together as primary objectives of private Reformed schools.  Administratively, the CRC was concerned with preserving not only a Reformed identity, but specifically a Dutch Reformed identity.

Unlike the RCA, the CRC made aggressive efforts to found primary schools.  Congregations would be responsible for this, and most of the congregations began with Sunday schools.[6]  Progress reports from congregations presented in 1875 attested to mixed success in starting schools, as well as a continued emphasis on the Dutch language.  In addition, a report from the Ridott congregation stated that most of the congregants did not speak Dutch, and that the children could not be taught in the Dutch language as originally intended.[7]  Possibly to the chagrin of many CRC ministers and members, their schools would have to embrace English as well as Dutch.

<p>By 1880, English in primary education was a necessity: “…it would be very desirable to have Christian Schools where both Holland and English are taught, so that our children need no[t] be ashamed of their education.  The State sanctions such schools.”[8]  However, while Christian Reformed day schools did have to carry English, Dutch would remain in the classrooms.</p>

          <h3 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Significance of the Masonic Controversy</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
           <p>The landscape of the Dutch immigrant community changed drastically due to the issue of Masonry. At its beginning, the Christian Reformed Church was no contender with the established Reformed Church. The CRC was mostly confined to a few immigrant Dutch churches in the west, whereas the RCA was a large denomination that had existed since 1628. The RCA was also the church that most Dutch migrants joined, with its detractor being seen merely a small group of theological purists.</p>

<p>The Masonic controversy of the 1880s changed that completely. In the course of a few years, the CRC’s population rose exponentially as a number of congregations left the RCA over the issue of Masonic membership. Prior to this second schism, the Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerk of the Netherlands (CGKN) had instructed its emigrating members to join the RCA. The CRC was in their eyes a small sect with no theological basis for the schism. The Masonic controversy caused the mother Dutch church to change its response virtually overnight. The RCA lost their theological reputation by permitting freemasonry and departing Dutch immigrants were advised by their mother denomination to join the CRC.[1] This coincided with the greatest decade of Dutch immigration (the 1880s), an intersection that resulted in a huge growth for the CRC. The issue of Freemasons, which may seem petty to the modern, transformed the relationship between the two denominations and helped solidify the CRC as a viable denomination.</p>
