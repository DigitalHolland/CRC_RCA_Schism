           <h4>The Schism and Culture </h4> 

This timeline tells the story of the religious life of dutch migrants from their arrival in America to joining the RCA to the schisms that formed the CRC. However, their Dutch identify and cultural factors are closely linked to their religious life. Religious groups produce distinctive cultures and worldviews. Culture is defined as “the beliefs, customs, arts, etc., of a particular society, group, place, or time the beliefs, customs, arts, etc., of a particular society, group, place, or time.” [1] When Dutch settlers came to Holland, MI to flee religious persecution in the Netherlands, they also brought a certain culture - one that was very different from the American culture surrounding them. Separatist attitudes, the protection of orthodox purity, and the desire to preserve Dutch identity and culture were three factors that played a huge role in the experience of these migrants, including the secession of the Christian Reformed Church (CRC) out of the Reformed Church of America (RCA). [2] Minor differences today still cause these two denominations to stay separated. However, most members today of the RCA and CRC cannot specifically explain most of the differences that exist and want the two denominations to work more closely together. [3]

<h4>Secularization Theory</h4>

Two theories, secularization theory and modernization theory, are crucial for understanding the separatist attitude that many in the Dutch Reformed churches brought to America. [4] Both the RCA and CRC were responding to secularization. Secularization theory is rooted in modernization theory which “posits that modern societies stand in stark contrast to traditional societies,” and these differences largely affect people. [5] Modernization erodes religious commitment because of increased industrialization, urbanization, technology advancements, advanced education, etc. [6] Secularization has resulted in a decline of religious involvement, an increase in modernization, and a decrease in the ability religion has to influence public society. There are two responses available then to religious communities dealing with secularization: accommodation to culture or resistance to culture. It was in this choice that the RCA and CRC differed.

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>

The RCA and CRC have similar heritage, liturgy, and culture. However, the CRC has historically placed greater emphasis on doctrinal purity and the RCA has been more focused on church unity. [7] The CRC broke off from the RCA due to concerns that the RCA was not theologically pure after becoming "Americanized." Yet overall, the nineteenth-century secession was not based solely on theological differences; there were many cultural factors that played a role in the schism. [8] As will be demonstrated in the timeline, both church denominations shared a common heritage and background.  However, differences in theology and doctrinal purity, in the face of cultural change, ultimately resulted in a denominational schism between the two.</p>

            <h4><i>The Afscheiding</i></h4>

The situation of the Dutch migrant takes on new meaning when viewed in light of the socio-religious climate within the Netherlands. The Dutch <i>Hervormde Kerk</i>, or state-sanctioned church, had been plagued by controversy in the decades after Napoleon’s downfall.In 1795, Napoleon’s revolutionary army came through the Netherlands, bringing anticlerical attitudes with them. Few Dutch protested this. The Enlightenment gained way through Europe during this time as well, which increased the tolerance of varied religions and theological differences [1]. Deism, a belief in an unknowable deity, replaced Reformed doctrine in Netherland’s public schools during the early 1800’s. In addition, the king decreed the Church Order of 1816 as official law of the land. This Church Order established the Hervomde Kerk (the state church) as the only religious body supported by the state for public worship [2]. Many pastors throughout the Netherlands supported this law. However, conservative Dutch Calvinists did not approve of these changes and felt it hindered their freedom of religion.

Strict Calvinist critics lambasted the increasing state control and liberalism of the <i>Hervormde Kerk</i> that occurred in the years after Napoleon's downfall and called for return to orthodoxy.The use of hymns instead of psalms and the practice of open communion were especially controversial issues. Government control over the training of clergy was one such issue that critics denounced as unjustifiable secular intrusion into the spiritual.[3] This finally culminated in the Afscheiding of 1834, when a number of prominent ministers and their congregations left the Hervormde Kerk.[4] Albertus Van Raalte, founding patron of Holland, was among them. By 1849, 1% of the population of the Netherlands had seceded from the <i>Hervormde Kerk</i>, a sizeable number. But this percentage pales when viewed alongside the fact that 50% of Dutch emigrants in the 1840s were seceded.[5]

 

<h4>Seceded Immigrants</h4>
<p>
It is important to note that the story of the Seceders or <i>Gereformeerd</i> (Reformed) in the Netherlands post 1834 is not one of unrelenting persecution. While the state countered Seceded action with fines and penalties, by 1840, the decision had been made to allow the Seceders to be, although fines were still being issued.[6] Still, it is beyond doubt that in the 1840s, Seceders comprised a disproportionate percentage of emigrants leaving the Netherlands. What that proportion was is up for debate. Some sources contend that at the peak year of Dutch migration in the 1840s, 1847, Seceders only made up about 35% of the migrants.[7] Dr. Robert Swierenga has argued that these dissidents were about half of the Dutch population that left.[8] Inconclusiveness aside, there is no debate that Seceders were disproportionately represented among these migrants.

           <h4>The Difficulty of Making Generalizations</h4>

It is difficult to make a general statement about the ultimate push factors that drove Dutch migrants to leave their homeland. Migration was a different process across the Netherlands, and it is impossible to make a sweeping generalization about the reason why so many left in the years prior to the Secession of 1857. It has already been concluded that the Netherlands was not in the same position as Ireland and other neighboring states in economic and agricultural health. This argument comes into new light when one considers that about 60% of migrants from Friesland in the 1880s were of the middling sort. [1] White collar emigrants, who made up about 40% of the employed populace in the Netherlands, only comprised about 10% of emigrants.[2] It can  tentatively be assumed that this was constant throughout all years of Dutch migration in the nineteenth century, with the upper class staying put and the poor having no means with which to migrate.

<h4>Class and Migration</h4>

Thus, a snapshot of the Dutch immigrants of the nineteenth century emerges. It can be tentatively concluded that most migrants from the Netherlands in this period were middle class or upper-lower class, the segments of society which were not well endowed but had enough resources to leave when potato and rye famine declined. Denominationally, they were a hodge-podge of different creeds, with Seceded Calvinist Protestants comprising a disproportionately high percentage of the migrants. Geographically, the northern provinces of Drenthe and Friesland were the provinces of origin for many of the migrants. Most of these were rural males.[3]

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Thus, all though this is too simplistic a conclusion, the Dutch migrant of the nineteenth century can be characterized as being a rural male laborer, with enough resources to migrate. He would have been more likely to be a Seceder than the rest of the population. He would most likely be from Drenthe, Groningen, Zeeland, Friesland or Flevoland.[4] If this migrant is wholly average in every way, he is 23.08 years old, the mean age of migrant males in this era.[5]</p>
